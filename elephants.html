               <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                <P>Elephants are mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order ProboscideaThe family Elephantidae also contains several now-extinct groups, including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs. Distinctive features of all elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. The pillar-like legs carry their great weight.</P>
                <p>The trunk, or proboscis, is a fusion of the nose and upper lip, although in early fetal life, the upper lip and trunk are separated.Elephants usually have 26 teeth: the incisors, known as the tusks, 12 deciduous premolars, and 12 molars. Unlike most mammals, which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives.</p>
                <p>Elephants are herbivorous and The African bush elephant can be found in habitats as diverse as dry savannahs, deserts, marshes, and lake shores, they prefer to stay near water.</p>
                  <p><strong> Where will you find them?</strong></p>
                  <p>You will find the elephants at Pen E22 right next to the Amphitheatre</p>
